## Usage

### Populate the periodic table

To automatically populate the periodic table with current NIST values, use
```csharp
            Loaders.LoadElements("elements.dat");
```

### Chemical Formulas

Elements (and isotopes) can be combined to create chemical formulas:
```csharp
            ChemicalFormula formula = new ChemicalFormula("C2H3NO");
```

### Isotopic Distribution

Isotopic distribution of a chemical compound can be calculated from its chemical formula:
```csharp
            IsotopicDistribution dist = new IsotopicDistribution(formula);
```

### Proteomics

Peptides can be created for a sequence of amino acids:
