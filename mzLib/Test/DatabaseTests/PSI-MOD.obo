remark: PSI-MOD version: 1.031.6
remark: RESID release: 75.00
remark: ISO-8601 date: 2022-06-13 12:12Z
remark: Annotation note 01 - "[PSI-MOD:ref]" has been replaced by PubMed:18688235.
remark: Annotation note 02 - When an entry in the RESID Database is annotated with different sources because the same modification can arise from different encoded amino acids, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different source instance carries the RESID cross-reference followed by a hash symbol "#" and a 3 or 4 character label. When an entry in the RESID Database is annotated as a general modification with the same enzymatic activity producing different chemical structures depending on natural variation in the nonproteinaceous substrate, on secondary modifications that do not change the nature of the primary modification, or on a combination of a primary and one or more secondary modifications on the same residue, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different instance carries the RESID cross-reference followed by the special tag "#var".
remark: Annotation note 03 - When an entry in the Unimod database is annotated as a general modification, and one or more instance sites are listed, then the PSI-MOD definition for each different site instance carries the Unimod cross-reference followed by a hash symbol and an amino acid code, "N-term" or "C-term".
remark: Annotation note 04 - The elemental formulas are in strict alphabetical order, not in CAS ("C" and "H" first) order. Isotope numbers are in parentheses before the element symbol, and an element should not occur in a formula both with and without an isotope number. In difference formulas, counts can be zero or negative.
remark: Annotation note 05 - In entries with an isotope indicator in the formula, average masses are meaningless and are assigned the value equal to the monoisotopic mass, but rounded to a lower precision; monoisotopic masses are calculated by using the masses for the indicated isotopes and the most common isotopes for other elements without isotope indicators in the formulas.
remark: Annotation note 06 - For cross-link modifications, the number following "Cross-link" in the comment record indicates the number of amino acid residues that appear in the origin record, used to check the difference formula and masses. This usage differs from RESID, where the cross-link number indicates the maximum number of peptide chains that can be cross-linked.
remark: Annotation note 07 - The synonym cross-reference "MOD:old name" has been replaced by "MOD:alternate name".
remark: Annotation note 08 - The DeltaMass listings for free amino acids have been removed. Most Unimod entries that have not been "approved" have by general agreement not been incorporated unless there has been a request for a specific term by a PRIDE submitter.
remark: Annotation note 09 - The Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm, OMSSA, enumerated list of modifications are being incorporated. The string values are synonyms with the synonymtypedef "OMSSA-label", and their integer values (which are supposed to be stable) are definition cross-references.
remark: Annotation note 10 - GNOme is the Glycan Naming and Subsumption Ontology (https://gnome.glyomics.org/), an ontology for the support of glycomics.  PSI-MOD does not have all possible glycans in its entries, just the ones that are noted to be on proteins and have been requested for addition.  GNOme uses GlyTouCan (http://glytoucan.org/) to provide stable accessions for glycans described at varyious degrees of characterization, including compositions (no linkage) and topologies (no carbon bond positions or anomeric configurations).

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 16 Average Mass Change:16 Notes:Green et al. in J. B. C. 270, 18209-18211 (1995) quote Kim and Raines in Eur. J. Biochem. 224, 109-114 (1994). Kim and Raines using ESI-MS and sulfhydryl group titration found that bovine seminal ribonuclease contains a single oxidized sulfhydryl group, which cannot participate in a disulfide bond. This form of cysteine is called sulfenic acid (-SOH).

comment: N4-methyl-L-asparagine, see MOD:0079, was found at a homologous position of the same protein in a closely related species. Since the peptide containing this modification was obtained by enzymatic cleavage, not cyanogen bromide cleavage, it could have experienced oxidation of the following methionine residue, leading to the erroneous attribution of a mass of 29 for the modification rather than 14. comment: This is a deprecated entry in RESID. It probably does not occur naturally [JSG].

comment: This modification was predicted for ribosomal protein S12 in Bacillus subtilis when the sequence in the original version of the genome was reported to have asparagine rather than aspartic acid at the position of the methylthioaspartic acid modification (see MOD:00237). Two groups independently confirmed that the genome sequence was incorrect. The sequence in the revised genome has aspartic acid at that position. This is a deprecated entry in RESID. It probably does not occur naturally [JSG].

comment: In a later publication, PubMed:19438211, the authors changed the enzyme activity, the connection from a histidine nitrogen to a cysteine sulfur, and the identity of the flavin from FMN to FAD. They now believe the modification is S-(8alpha-FAD)-L-cysteine, see MOD:00152. This is a deprecated entry in RESID. It probably does not occur naturally [JSG].

comment: At least three protein crystallographic structures have been reported with this modification. However, no chemical evidence for this modification is provided, there were no reports of this modification before these crystallographic reports, and there is no metabolic explanation for the conversion of a formyl group to a carboxy group. There is confusion in its description, and misnaming is common. This modification is probably a misidentification of N-(dihydroxymethyl)methionine, the hydrated form of N-formylmethionine.

comment: From DeltaMass: A secondary modification affecting peptides with S-carbamoylmethyl-L-cysteine (CamC) at the N-terminus. These exist in enzymatic digests of proteins that have been S-alkylated with iodoacetamide. Cyclization of N-terminal CamC gives a residue of (R)-5-oxoperhydro-1,4-thiazine-3-carboxylic acid. Peptides in which this has occurred become more hydrophobic, and lose 17 Da from the N-terminal residue.

comment: From DeltaMass: References: The conversion of glutamic acid to pyroglutamic was reported for the beta-amyloid protein. Miller et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophy. (1993) 301, 41-52 [DeltaMass]. The modification in amyloid protein is probably an artifact of treatment with strong acid under anhydrous conditions. Peptides with N-terminal glutamic acid isolated from single cells of Aplysia neurons show partial conversion to pyroglutamic acid, possibly dependent on a temperature sensitive factor [JSG].

In PubMed:15627961, triiodothyronine (see MOD:00186) is discussed, but triiodotyrosine is not mentioned. This modification probably does not exist, and may be a confusion of "tyrosine" for "thyronine", a common error [JSG].

def: "A protein modification that is produced by formation of an adduct with 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, AEBS." [DeltaMass:235, PubMed:8597590, Unimod:276]
comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 183 Average Mass Change:183 References:We have found that AEBSF modifies many proteins by covalent attachment, preferentially on Tyr, and to a lesser extent on Lys, His, and the amino-terminus. These modifications were identified by electrospray MS of the proteins (adds 183 Da per AEBS-group) and by peptide mapping and MS/MS. All the proteins we examined were modified after 24 hrs. at 4 C with 1 mM AEBSF in TRIS, pH 8.0. The reaction is 10-20x slower at pH 7; however AEBSF is quite stable in aqueous solution and the extent of to which the protein is modified continues to increase for several days. We have seen the addition of 10 or more AEBS-groups to proteins after prolonged storage. We found no equivalent modification from PMSF, probably because it degrades so quickly. We no longer use AEBSF, and urge caution to those who do. To address the problem, Boehringer Mannheim (now Roche Molecular Biochemicals) introduced Pefabloc PLUS which includes an additional component to compete for these side reactions. In our limited experience with Pefabloc PLUS, it reduces the +183 modifications, but does not always eliminate them. As a result, we prefer PMSF, despite its own set of drawbacks. We have never found PMSF-induced modification of proteins (except trypsin), probably due to its short half-life in aqeous solution.

comment: From DeltaMass: In an attempt to clarfiy the difference between the modification of cysteine to lanthionine and cysteine to dehydroalanine, the following contributions from the ABRF email forum are presented:Structurally speaking lanthionine is like cystine but lacks one S atom. I imagine one can think of it as a condensation of cysteine and dehydroalanine but I do not know how it is made biologically. Dehydroalanine could be derived from either serine or cysteine. If I recall Biochem 101 correctly lanthionine was first found in wool.-Lowell Ericsson (ERICSSONLH@U.WASHINGTON.EDU)As far as I know, the structure of lanthionine is two Ala's joined by a single sulphur with the loss of two hydrogens from the methyl group of the Ala.Stephen Bayne (sbay@novo.dk)Regarding the structure of lanthionine and dehydroalanine: dehydroalanine is formed by the loss of one sulfur atom and two hydrogen atoms from ONE cysteine residue. lanthionine is formed from TWO cysteines, is a thioether, and contains one sulfur atom less than the amino acid cystine. Dan McCormick (MCCORMICK@rcf.mayo.edu) [DeltaMass]. Most bacterially produced lanthionine crosslinks are made by dehydration of L-serine to dehydroalanine, and then reaction with L-cysteine so as to produce chiral inversion at the alpha-carbon of the original L-serine; the lanthionine is a meso-diastereomer with L-configuration of the original cysteine alpha-carbon and D-configuration of the original L-serine alpha-carbon. In cypemycin dehydroalanine has been shown to be produced by loss of hydrogen sulfide from cysteine. Beta-elimination of hydrogen sulfide does occur during treatment with performic acid [JSG].

def: "A protein modification that effectively converts an L-serine residue to O3-xylosylserine." [PubMed:8747463, RESID:AA0406]
comment: One glycosylated serine with weak electron density was modeled as O3-alpha-xylosylserine, while O3-alpha-mannosyl serine and threonine were modeled at ten other positions. The authors do not discuss this exception or provide chemical evidence for it. Since an O3-xylosyl serine modification has not been reported in any other fungal proteins, the modification is probably also an O3-alpha-mannosyl serine, see MOD:00810 [JSG].

comment: The normal biological process involves formation of an amide of an amino acid residue in a peptide sequence where it is followed by a glycine and two basic residues, either arginine or lysine, although in some taxa only one basic residue is required. The peptide is cleaved after the basic residues, glycine is oxidized to hydroxyglycine, which decomposes to release a carboxamide C-terminal [JSG].

Notes: The elimination of CO2 will regenerate glutamate as if there was no modification. However, peaks appearing with an interval of 44 is quite characteristic. It would be noteworthy to remind that loss of 44 from a gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing peptide may be observed not only as a result of spontaneous decarboxylation but also as an artifact under some ionization conditions such as negative ion mode MALDI.

Mass Spectrom. 3(9), 314-19 Notes: Fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry of a synthetic renin substrate decapeptide (Pro-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Val-Ile-His-D-Lys) indicated the presence of several side products, including a component 12 Da higher in mass. Low-energy collisionally activated ***decompn*** analyses were performed using a hybrid tandem instrument and demonstrated that the heavier side product had two components, in which the structural modification was either at the N- or the C-terminus. Addnl. analyses of the N-acetyl deriv. indicated that for each component the structural modification blocked a site of N-acetylation. It is suggested that the formation of these side products is attributable to the generation of formaldehyde, during removal of the histidine protecting group (benzyloxymethyl), which reacts with the N-terminus of the peptide to give an imidazolidinone structure or with the D- ***lysine***.epsilon.-amine group to yield an ***imine*** . While the precise genesis of the side-products remains speculative, it is clear that the combined strategy of derivatization and tandem mass spectrometry has allowed structural conclusions concerning individual components of an isobaric mixt.

The mechanism involves piperidine-mediated beta-elimination of sulfur (with the protecting group on), followed by addition of piperidine across the C-terminaldehydroalanine. Since this last-mentioned step creates a chiral center, a mixture of diastereomers is formed which in special cases can be separatedby HPLC. Another problem with C-terminal Cys is racemization; some references in the review article by Andreu, Albericio, Sole, Munson, Ferrer, and Barany in Pennington-Dunn Peptide Synthesis and Purification Protocols, vol 35, 1994, pp. 91-169.

comment: [From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 64.] Although selenocysteine-charged tRNA(Sec) is biosynthesized from serine-charged tRNA(Sec), in peptide work selenocysteine is usually considered as either a natural residue or as a modified cysteine residue. This entry is for the artifactual formation of L-selenocysteine from serine. For encoded L-selenocysteine, use MOD:00031 [JSG].

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 67 Average Mass Change:67 References:http://www.abrf.org/archives/hmail/0008/0007.html Notes:1.) Get rid of the DBU. It can cause piperidine amides at Asp residues. The tbu ester side chain comes off during synthesis and the residue is trans-amidated with piperidine (+67Da by MS). If you haven't yet seen this, you will. Even "normal" 20% pip/DMF (NMP) will cause this, but less frequently. Literature exists for this; I don't remember the exact reference. David H.

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 162 Average Mass Change:162 Notes: (from the ABRF discussion list archive) There may be ... things in the reagent K that would allow cleavage of the peptide to occur at the wrong place...in this case it removes the dimethoxybenzyl group first inactivating that site for cleavage, and it goes after tne next amide bond closer to the resin. Try the TFA/TIS/water/EDT cocktail...TFA = 92%, TIS =3%, and water is at 5%. .. had this issue on longer peptides.. and by increasing the amount of water a little bit... able to elminate this problem.

comment: CAUTION - peptides of 2-hydroxyglycine are known to be unstable, decaying to break the peptide backbone or to form peptidyl amides [see J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111, 1933-1934, 1989, and J. Org. Chem. 57, 3916-3921, 1992]. If computer analysis of tandem mass-spectrometric results predicts this modification, then it is most probable that there are multiple isobaric peptides differing in the location of multiple hydroxylation modifications [JSG].

comment: CAUTION - observations of this modifation are attributable to artifacts produced in preparation. It is extremely unlikely that eukaryotes produce this modification, because an enzyme acting to form the methyl ester of L-aspartyl peptides would interfere with the D-aspartyl peptide repair mechanism [JSG].

comment: The deamidation and methylation of L-asparagine has not been reported as a natural modification. It is extremely unlikely that eukaryotes produce this modification, because a natural process that would form L-aspartic acid 4-methyl ester from either L-aspartic acid or L-asparagine would interfere with the D-aspartyl peptide repair mechanism [JSG].

comment: For alpha-amino acids, both N-alpha-monomethylation and complete N-alpha protonation and trimethylation have been observed, but incomplete dimethylation has not been reported as a natural process. For N-terminal proline residues, dimethylation can only be effectively accomplished with a protonated imino group, whereas this process accounts only for dimethylation and not protonation. See MOD:00889.

comment: For amino acids residues, amine trimethylation can effectively only be accomplished with an aminium, protonated primary amino, group. This process accounts only for trimethylation and not protonation. The alternative N2Me3+Res process (MOD:01698) accounts for both protonation and trimethylation.

comment: Contrary to the impression given in Unimod entry 26, the cyclization of N-terminal S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine is not reported in PubMed:1263538. The cyclization would be expected to proceed under strongly acidic conditions [JSG].

comment: For amino acids residues, amine trimethylation can effectively only be accomplished with an aminium, protonated primary amino, group. This process accounts only for trimethylation and not protonation. The alternative N2Me3+Gly process (MOD:01982) accounts for both protonation and trimethylation.

def: "A protein modification that effectively replaces a hydrogen atom of a residue with one of the Applied Biosystems iTRAQ4plex reagent reporter+balance groups." [Unimod:214]
comment: The reagent consists of a reporter group, a balance group and a protein reactive N-oxysuccinimide group. The reporter group, an isotopically labeled 1,4-dimethylpiperazine, is connected to a carbonyl balance group that is isotopically labeled to produce a nominally isobaric combined modification. Four versions of chemically identical iTRAQ4plex moyeties, but with different isotope distribution. This modification is calculated as the average of the four species. It has no isotopic distribution reality, the exact mass does not correspond to any real isotopic distribution.
